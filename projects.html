            <h2>Project #1</h2>
            <h3><a href="https://github.com/CDennis67/TheHollerHookbook" target="_">The Holler Hookbook</a></h3>
            <p>
                The Holler Hookbook aims to be a resource for those who want a resource for fishing in Kentucky. 
                Through the course of development, this project hopes to provide both a tool to locate ideal weather conditions as
                well as a reference guide for various fish, gear, techniques, and conditions. I also intend on utilizing hand-drawn
                illustrations for much of this project.

            <h2>Project #2</h2>
            <h3><a href="https://github.com/CDennis67/RiotB" target="_">Run It On The Beat - RiotB</a></h3>
            <p>
                The goal of RiotB is to help users enjoy the experience of hlistening to the perfect song that matches your rhythm while walking, running, 
                cycling, and more. There is planned integration for both a rhythm/BPM based API as well as a music database API. The intended
                functionality would allow users to either select a genre of music and narrow down the desired songs based on the BPM or to simply
                select their BPM range of choice for a list of songs to be generated. A site dedicated to calculating a users steps per minute is linked.

            <h2>Project #3</h2>
            <h3><a href="https://github.com/CDennis67/ArtHistoryQuiz.git" target="_">Art History Quiz</a></h3>
            <p>
                This repository is home to a project meant to help refresh myself on major movements of art history, specifically painting, as well as 
                giving others an interactive way to learn. This project will require simplification of identifying traits for paintings movements, 
                examples of notable artists and paintings for each movement, as well as a simple quiz system to let the user practice their skills
                for identification. The color choices will also be inspired by historical oil painting colors.
